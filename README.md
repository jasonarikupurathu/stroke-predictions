# Stroke Predictions

# Business Problem:
Using a dataset from Kaggle containing various health-related features, we were able to predict if a patient is susceptible to a stroke. These features included, gender, age, if a patient had hypertension, if a patient had heart disease, etc.

<br>
Since stroke is the second leading cause of death globally, we believe that this information is vital.

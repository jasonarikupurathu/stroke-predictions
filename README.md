# Stroke Predictions

# Business Problem:
Using a dataset from Kaggle containing various health-related features, we were able to predict if a patient is susceptible to a stroke. These features included, gender, age, if a patient had hypertension, if a patient had heart disease, etc.
<br>
<br>
Since stroke is the second leading cause of death globally, we believe that this information is vital.
<br>
<br>
"aside from the obvious need to minimize the rate of false negatives to save lives, hospitals & doctors can use this to protect against malpractice lawsuits by failing to identify patients who have had strokes"
